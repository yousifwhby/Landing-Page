# Landing Page Project

## Creating global Variables

In the top part of the js file are most of the _variables_ used in the code.

## Navbar

1. **Dynamic navbar**: if we added another section through HTML will show a link in the navbar.

2. **Hiding navbar**: while scrolling the navbar will go out of the frame using *window* object and *onscroll* event to hide the navbar is scrolling and not at the top.

## Active Class
1. Using new *getBoundingClientRect()* method got the values between(0,300) from the top or (-500 , 150:200) from the top that the section come to view.
2. Using *Classlist* to add active class to both navbar and the sections.

## Scroll
1. Scroll event used in addEventlistener to activate the live section function and adding the active class.
2. Smooth Scrolling effect was added through CSS by the **scroll-behavior** making the transition from section to section smooth.
